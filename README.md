# Kaggle Project: House Prices
## Advance Regression Techniques

One of the (supposedly) basic projects of kaggle. It's a database of 79 explanatory variables and 1460 observations with different information that you can get about a house and his price.

The goal of this project is to be able to apply feature enginnering and advance regression techniques like random forest and gradient boosting.

My guess is that the high amount of variables makes it necessary to apply techniques to reduce the dimensionality, so I'll need to investigate a bit before.

Since I'm still green in ML I'm going to try a wide range of methods, not only the advance ones.
